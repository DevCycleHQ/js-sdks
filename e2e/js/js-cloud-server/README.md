# DevCycle JS SDK ESM E2E Test

## Getting started

If you want to run the e2e app, from the root folder:

Set up a `.dev.vars` file in this folder containing your DevCycle Server SDK Key for your project:
    - ```DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY=<YOUR SERVER SDK KEY>```

```bash
yarn e2e:js-cloud-server:start
```
