# JS-SDK ESM E2E Test App

## Getting started

### Install dependencies

Then, to init the project

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the project

If you want to run the project, simply run

```bash
yarn start
```

`Webpack` will then indicate you to open `localhost:3000`. When you'll do so, you'll see the project running.
