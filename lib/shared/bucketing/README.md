# DevCycle Bucketing

This package contains the shared logic used by Javascript-based DevCycle products to evaluate a user's information
against a set of segmentation filters and determine eligibility for a given feature. It also makes decisions about
which variation to serve a user in a multi-variate feature.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared-bucketing` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
