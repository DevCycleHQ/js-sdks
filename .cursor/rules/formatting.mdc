# Formatting

- All formatting is deferred to Prettier for supported file types (JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.).
- Run prettier (`yarn prettier:format`) to apply formatting changes for files that are changed.
- ESLint is used to enforce code quality and linting rules.
- No additional formatting rules are enforced by Cursor.
