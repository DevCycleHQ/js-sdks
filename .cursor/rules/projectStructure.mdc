# Project Structure Guide

- This repository is managed as an NX monorepo.
- The main configuration files are [nx.json](mdc:nx.json) and [project.json](mdc:project.json).
- The main project root contains configuration files such as [package.json](mdc:package.json), [tsconfig.base.json](mdc:tsconfig.base.json), and [jest.config.ts](mdc:jest.config.ts).
- Source code is organized under the `lib/`, `sdk/`, and `dev-apps/` directories.
- Shared types and utilities are found in [lib/shared/](mdc:lib/shared).
- Each project (library, SDK, or app) is defined in its own directory, typically under [lib/](mdc:lib), [sdk/](mdc:sdk), or [dev-apps/](mdc:dev-apps).
- NX commands can be used to build, test, and manage dependencies between these projects.

## SDKs
- The [sdk/](mdc:sdk) directory contains SDKs for different platforms and frameworks.
- Each SDK has its own directory.
- Main source code is in `src/`.
- Tests are in `__tests__/`.
- Mocks are in `__mocks__/` where present.
- Notable SDKs include:
  - [js/](mdc:sdk/js): JavaScript client SDK
  - [js-cloud-server/](mdc:sdk/js-cloud-server): JavaScript cloud/server SDK
  - [nodejs/](mdc:sdk/nodejs): Node.js SDK
  - [nextjs/](mdc:sdk/nextjs): Next.js SDK

## Development & Example Apps
- The [dev-apps/](mdc:dev-apps) directory contains development and example applications for testing, demos, and integration.
- Each app has its own directory, with main code in `src/`.
