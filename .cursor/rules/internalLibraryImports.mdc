# Internal Library Imports

- Internal libraries should be imported using their package name (e.g., `@devcycle/bucketing`) rather than relative or absolute paths.
- The package path for a library (such as `@devcycle/bucketing`) can be found in the library's package.json file under the `name` field.
- This applies to code in @lib/, @cf-workers/, and @services/, except for test and script files.
