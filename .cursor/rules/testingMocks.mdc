# Testing and Mocks

- Source files in @lib/, @cf-workers/, and @services/ should have a corresponding test file.
- Test files can be located in `__tests__` folders or have `.spec.ts`, `.spec.js`, `.test.js`, or `.test.ts` suffixes.
- Test and script files themselves are excluded from this rule.
- Tests are placed in `__tests__/` directories within each package or module.
- Mock implementations are placed in `__mocks__/` directories within each package or module.
- This convention is followed in both SDKs and shared libraries.
- Test files can have `.spec.ts`, `.spec.js`, `.test.js`, or `.test.ts` suffixes.
