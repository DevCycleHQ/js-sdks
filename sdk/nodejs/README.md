# DevCycle Node.js Server SDK

The Node.js Server SDK for DevCycle.

DevCycle is a feature flag management provider with robust support for user targeting, realtime updates of flag values
and deep integrations with your development workflow.

This SDK uses local bucketing to perform all user segmentation and bucketing locally in the SDK, 
providing immediate responses to variable and feature requests for a user. 
The SDK will download the latest version of your DevCycle environments configuration from a CDN on initialization,
and will periodically poll the CDN for configuration changes.
