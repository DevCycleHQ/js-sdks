# DevCycle Javascript Cloud Bucketing Server SDK

DevCycle is a feature flag management provider with robust support for user targeting, realtime updates of flag values
and deep integrations with your development workflow.

This SDK is used to integrate DevCycle with your Javascript server-side application, where a Node.js runtime isn't available.
Example use-cases would be Cloudflare Workers and other edge-worker runtimes.

This SDK makes API requests to DevCycle's [Bucketing API](https://docs.devcycle.com/bucketing-api/) to perform bucketing.
See our [System Architecture Documentation](https://docs.devcycle.com/introduction/architecture#cloud-bucketing-server-sdk-architecture) for more details.

### Installation

Our library can be found on npm and installed by the following:

```
npm install @devcycle/js-cloud-server-sdk"
