# DevCycle Javascript Cloud Bucketing Server SDK

This SDK is used to integrate DevCycle with your Javascript server-side application, where a Node.js runtime isn't available.
Example use-cases would be Cloudflare Workers and other edge-worker runtimes.

This SDK makes API requests to DevCycle's [Bucketing API](https://docs.devcycle.com/bucketing-api/) to perform bucketing.
See our [System Architecture Documentation](https://docs.devcycle.com/introduction/architecture#cloud-bucketing-server-sdk-architecture) for more details.

### Installation

Our library can be found on npm and installed by the following:

```
npm install @devcycle/js-cloud-server-sdk"
```

### Usage
